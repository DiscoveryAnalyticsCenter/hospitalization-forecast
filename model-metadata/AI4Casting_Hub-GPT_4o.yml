  Probabilistic Forecast for Respiratory Virus Activity

  Objective
  Generate a probabilistic forecast for weekly respiratory virus case counts (Covid, Influenza, RSV) across multiple geographic regions over a 4-week horizon (0–3 weeks ahead). The forecast should include quantile-based uncertainty estimates.

  Input Data Description
  The input dataset (concatenated-hospitalization-data.csv) contains historical weekly case counts of respiratory viruses in different regions. The dataset includes:

  time → Date of the report (DD-MM-YYYY)
  geo_value → Specific geographic area (e.g., "Central", "Region X")
  geo_type → Type of region (e.g., "OH Region", "Province")
  covid → Weekly COVID-19 case counts or hospitalizations
  flu → Weekly Influenza case counts
  rsv → Weekly RSV case counts
  
  Forecasting Task:  

  1. Time Horizons:  
    - Forecast four future weeks (horizons 0, 1, 2, 3).  
    - Horizon 0 corresponds to the Saturday exactly one week after the last available data point.  
    - Each forecasted week corresponds to subsequent Saturdays.  

  2. Reference & Target Dates:  
    - Reference Date → The last available data point + 7 days in concatenated-rvdss-data.csv.
      (E.g., If the latest data is from 2024-11-23, then the reference date = 2024-11-30.)  
    - Target End Dates → Saturdays for each horizon (0–3 weeks ahead).  

  3. Quantile Forecasting:  
    - Provide probabilistic forecasts using 7 quantiles:  
      [0.025, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 (median), 0.75, 0.9, 0.975].  
    - Ensure quantile consistency (higher quantiles should always be ≥ lower quantiles).  

  4. Output Format:  
    The output should be structured for CSV compatibility with the following columns:  

    reference_date |    target   | horizon | target_end_date | location | output_type | output_type_id | value  
    ---------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|----------|-------------|----------------|-------  
    2025-02-08 | wk inc covid hosp | 0 | 2025-02-08 | Ontario | quantile | 0.025 | 11 
    2025-02-08 | wk inc flu hosp | 1 | 2025-02-15 | Ontario | quantile | 0.025 | 9  
    2025-02-08 | wk inc rsv hosp | 0 | 2025-02-08 | Ontario | quantile | 0.025 | 12  
    2025-02-08 | wk inc rsv hosp | 1 | 2025-02-15 | Ontario | quantile | 0.025 | 1  

  
  Column Descriptions:  
  - reference_date →  The forecast generation date, which is the last available data in concatenated-rvdss-data.csv + 7 days.
  - target → The type of target:  
    - "wk inc covid hosp" → Weekly Covid Positive Hospitalizaion Case Count.  
    - "wk inc flu hosp" → Weekly Influenza Positive Hospitalizaion Case Count.  
    - "wk inc rsv hosp" → Weekly RSV Positive Hospitalizaion Case Count.  
  - horizon → Forecasting weeks ahead (0 = last available data + 7 days, 1 = next week, etc.).  
  - target_end_date → The Saturday of the forecasted week.  
  - location → Geographic region (geo_value).  
  - output_type → Always "quantile".  
  - output_type_id → The probability quantile (0.025, 0.1, ..., 0.975).  
  - value → The predicted percentage positive lab detections for that quantile.  

  Forecasting Approach:  
  To ensure accuracy and robustness, forecasts should be generated using a diverse set of models, including:  

  1. Mathematical & Statistical Models → ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.  
  2. Machine Learning → Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Bayesian Regression.  
  3. Deep Learning → LSTMs, Transformer-based architectures.  
  4. Hybrid & Ensemble Models → Combining multiple models for improved accuracy.  

  Model Selection Criteria:  
  - Ensure models capture seasonality and trends in respiratory virus activity.  
  - Use rigorous validation techniques to select the best-performing models per region.  
  - If applicable, blend multiple models for enhanced reliability.  

  Workflow & Performance Considerations:  
  - Allow sufficient time for model execution, as some algorithms may require longer computation times.  
  - Do not interrupt the workflow prematurely—ensure all models complete their runs to achieve optimal performance.  
  - If using parallel processing, allocate sufficient resources for efficient execution.  

  Deliverables:  
  - A structured CSV-compatible file containing probabilistic forecasts for each region and virus type.  
  - The forecasts should be probabilistically sound, consistent across quantiles, and generalizable across different regions.
